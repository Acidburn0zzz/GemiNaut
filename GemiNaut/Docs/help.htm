<h1>Help for GemiNaut</h1>

<p>GemiNaut is a user friendly GUI client for the Gemini protocol and content 
format by Luke Emmet. 
It aims to provide a comfortable and user friendly experience of Gemini on MS Windows.</p>
 <p>In many ways it behaves just like a normal web browser, except it is for 
 viewing <code>gemini://</code> pages.</p>

 <h3>What is Gemini?</h3>
 <p>Gemini is a protocol and text format designed to radically simpify the experience of 
 writing and sharing hypertext content on the Internet:</p>
 <ul>
	 <li><a  href="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space">
	 gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space</a> - Gemini Project home (gemini)</li>
	 <li><b>https://gemini.circumlunar.space</b> - Gemini Project home (www)</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Key Features of GemiNaut</h3>
 <ul>

	 from the link style</li>
	 <li>View source</li>
	 <li>Page based table of contents</li>
 </ul>
 <p>These are described in more detail below.</p>
 <h3>Familiar browser design</h3>
 <p>GemiNaut provides a usable and familiar browsing experience for exploring 
 Geminispace. Using your keyboard and mouse you click on links and use the 
 back/forward/home buttons.</p>
 <p>You can use your wheelmouse to scroll or to zoom in and out 
 (Ctrl+Wheelmouse) and use Alt+cursor keys to navigate back and forwards. Use 
 Tab to step through the links.</p>
 <p>You can set your own home page via the <em>View-&gt;Settings-&gt;Set home page</em> 
 menu.</p>
 <h3>Smooth content wrap and flow</h3>
 <p>Gemini/GMI content from servers will be shown wrapped to your current window. </p>
 <ul>
	 <li>Bullets and links are indented as expected </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Content theming engine</h3>
 <p>GemiNaut has a number of rendering themes to present the content. This 
 allows themes to be readily developed. These include:</p>
 <ul>
	 <li>Fabric (default) - a site-specific theme that shows each Gemini site 
	 with a slightly different visual theme -&nbsp; described 
	 below. It also shows a table of contents for those pages that have a 
	 heading structure.</li>
	 <li>Plain - a simple plain text theme, black text on a white background</li>
	 <li>Terminal - a monospaced terminal theme - white text on a black 
	 background</li>
	 <li>Unified - a theme showing common navigation links and search options on 
	 every page</li>
 </ul>
 <p>To switch between themes, choose the options below the <em>View-&gt;Themes</em> 
 menu</p>
 <h3>Site specific themes</h3>
 <p>A unique feature of GemiNaut is its ability to create site specific themes. 
 Unlike HTML pages on the web, Gemini pages (GMI) do not have visual style 
 information. This is an intentional part of Gemini's design and keeps 
 everything simple.</p>
 <p>You can use one of the generic themes (e.g. Plain, Terminal) to view all 
 content in GemiNaut. However these themes do not visually distinguish one site 
 from another. So it is harder to determine when you traverse from one site to 
 another - this can only be confirmed by looking at the address bar.</p>
 <p>The <em>Fabric</em> theme provides a solution to this problem by automatically 
 creating a unique theme for each Gemini site. Each site will be distinguished 
 by:</p>
 <ul>
	 <li>Page background - a "fabric" unique to the current site, as if the page 
	 is laid out on a different fabric background, like a tablecloth.</li>
	 <li>Page marker - a unique pseudo-icon for each site in the top right hand 
	 corner. You can click the page marker to 
	 go to the &quot;home&quot; of each site.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Sites are identified as follows:</p>
 <ul>
	 <li>If the URL contains <code>/users/&lt;username&gt;</code> or <code>/~&lt;username&gt;</code> then this 
	 taken to be a user specific sub 
	 site, and the theme will be specific to that user on that server.</li>
	 <li>Otherwise, the domain is used to determine the theme.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Link styles</h3>
 <p>Link types in GemiNaut can be easily distinguished:</p>
 <p style="margin-left:2em"><span style="font-size:1.5em;">&rArr;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gemini links start with a "fat" arrow. 
 These will open in GemiNaut.</p>
 <p style="margin-left:2em"><span style="font-size:1.5em;">&#8669;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;External links have a "squiggly" arrow. 
 These will open in the system web browser.</p>
 
 <p>Additionally, links to probable binary files are labelled for ease of 
 identification. These will open in an external browser.</p>
 <h3>View source</h3>
 <p>You can view the source of any GMI page via the <em>View-&gt;Source</em> menu.</p>
